# CanopyLayers.jl


## About
CanopyLayers.jl was the canopy radiative transfer module for CliMA Land v0.1. Since CliMA Land v0.2, the core functions are moved to LeafOptics.jl and CanopyRadiativeTransfer.jl, and thus this module has been deprecated. Please checkout the remastered packages for more better user experiences.
