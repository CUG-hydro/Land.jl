# CLIMA-Land

Note that CliMA Land is being refactored. During this process, no new feature will be added and only bug fix is allowed. We wish to present the refactored CliMA Land in the near future, please wait for the new version v0.2.

This project is supposed to be a community effort, leveraging all the work that has been done in Land Surface Modeling from various groups around the world. The ultimate goal here is to build a Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum (SPAC) bio-physical model that represents the state of the art and can be coupled to the Climate-Machine, i.e. Caltech's CLIMA initiative. The model will include multi-layer soil and canopy properties and models "observables" that can be used as constraint, e.g. Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) on the leaf-level propagated through the canopy, reflectance in various bands as measured from space, soil and vegetation moisture content. A specific focus will be on water-carbon feedbacks by testing recent developments in stomatal optimization theories as well as plant hydraulics. We will try to adhere to some [coding structure](https://github.com/gbonan/CLM-ml_v0) developed by Gordan Bonan but implement parts from other programs, such as [SCOPE](https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE).

The entire model will be written in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) (Julia: ["Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like Fortran"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h8rQyEpiZA&t=)), which should make the barrier of entry lower for incoming students, PostDocs, etc). If you want to contribute, please contact us (cfranken@caltech.edu).
