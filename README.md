# CliMA Land


## About

CliMA Land is a next generation Land Surface Model (LSM) designed to use the broadly available remote sensing data as well as ground-based flux measurements. CliMA Land is a highly modular platform to promote research at different scales from tissue to organ, whole plant, and ecosystem. Therefore, we deliver CliMA Land via a patch of packages (also referred to as sub-modules) to reduce the time used to initialize a research project. As a result, the repository is more a collection of tutorials and examples for users, rather than a place to store the code for all sub-modules.

This project is supposed to be a community effort, leveraging all the work that has been done in Land Surface Modeling from various groups around the world. The ultimate goal is to build a bio-physical model that represents the state of the art and can be coupled to the CliMA Earth System Model (ESM), i.e. Caltech's CliMA initiative. The CliMA Land can be customized to represent Soil-Plant-Air-Continuum (SPAC) with different complexities, e.g. multi-layer soil and canopy properties and "observables" that can be used as constraint:
- Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) on the leaf-level propagated through the canopy;
- Reflectance at various bands as measured from space;
- Soil and vegetation moisture content.

A specific focus of CliMA Land will be on water-carbon feedbacks by testing recent developments in optimization theories as well as plant physiology. We will try to implement latest  adhere to some [coding structure](https://github.com/gbonan/CLM-ml_v0) developed by Gordan Bonan but implement parts from other programs, such as [SCOPE](https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE).

The entire model will be written in [Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/) (Julia: ["Looks like Python, feels like Lisp, runs like Fortran"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h8rQyEpiZA&t=)), which should make the barrier of entry lower for incoming students, PostDocs, etc). If you want to contribute, please contact us (cfranken@caltech.edu).
