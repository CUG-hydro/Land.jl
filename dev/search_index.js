With the regeneration of the substrate RuBP through the light reactions (using produced ATP and NADPH), the core cycle of photosynthesis is formed.

Several effects can be observed in the plots below: The first SIF peak at 680nm is much weaker in the forward direction than in the backward direction as more the re-absorption within the leaf is much higher for the forward direction. Similarly, blue incident light penetrates the leaf less than at higher wavelengths, so the chlorophyll re-absorption (backwards) is less re-absorbed by chlorophyll as it emanates from less deep layers.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot Mb matrix\ncontourf(wle, wlf, leaf.Mb)\nxlabel!(\"Excitation wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Emission wavelength (nm)\")\ntitle!(\"Fluorescence backward (refl) emission (Mb)\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot Mf matrix\ncontourf(wle, wlf, leaf.Mf)\nxlabel!(\"Excitation wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Emission wavelength (nm)\")\ntitle!(\"Fluorescence forward (transmission) emission (Mf)\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Define a few wavelengths:\nwl_blue = 450.0;\nwl_red = 600.0;\nwl_FarRed = 740.0;\nwl_Red = 685.0;\nind_wle_blue  = argmin(abs.(wle .-wl_blue));\nind_wle_red = argmin(abs.(wle .-wl_red));\nind_wlf_FR  = argmin(abs.(wlf .-wl_FarRed));\nind_wlf_R  = argmin(abs.(wlf .-wl_Red));\nind_red = argmin(abs.(wl .-wl_Red));\nind_NIR = argmin(abs.(wl .-800));\nnothing #hide","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot some cross section in wle and wlf space:\nplot(wlf,leaf.Mf[:,ind_wle_blue], color=[:black], lw = 2 , label=\"Forward SIF, excited at $wl_blue nm\")\nplot!(wlf,leaf.Mb[:,ind_wle_blue],color=[:orange], lw = 2 , label=\"Backward SIF, excited at $wl_blue nm\" )\nplot!(wlf,leaf.Mf[:,ind_wle_red], color=[:black],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Forward SIF, excited at $wl_red nm\" )\nplot!(wlf,leaf.Mb[:,ind_wle_red], color=[:orange],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Backward SIF, excited at $wl_red nm\" )\nxlabel!(\"Wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Fluorescence\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"# Plot some cross section in wle and wlf space:\nplot(wle,leaf.Mf[ind_wlf_FR,:], color=[:black], lw = 2 , label=\"Forward SIF, emitted at $wl_FarRed nm\")\nplot!(wle,leaf.Mb[ind_wlf_FR,:],color=[:orange], lw = 2 , label=\"Backward SIF, emitted at $wl_FarRed nm\" )\nplot!(wle,leaf.Mf[ind_wlf_R,:], color=[:black],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Forward SIF, emitted at $wl_Red nm\" )\nplot!(wle,leaf.Mb[ind_wlf_R,:], color=[:orange],line=(:dash,2), label=\"Backward SIF, emitted at $wl_Red nm\" )\nxlabel!(\"Absorbed Wavelength (nm)\")\nylabel!(\"Fluorescence\")","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#Leaf-reflectance-and-transmission-1","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Leaf reflectance and transmission","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"generated/Radiation_Test_BRDF/#","page":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","title":"Reflected and Emitted Radiance","text":"Within Fluspect, leaf reflectance and transmission is calculated (this part is actually identical to what PROSPECT is doing and much less involved than the Fluorescence part).

In addition, gas exchange datasets performed at different temperatures might actually alias different confounding factors into the V_cmax determination, so that the actually fitted V_cmax strongly depends on the model formulation. E.g. mesophyll conductance is usually ignore in deriving V_cmax but might be temperature dependent, which can cause T-dependent errors in V_cmax.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Leaf-Photosynthesis-Rates/#","page":"Enzyme catalysis T-dependence","title":"Enzyme catalysis T-dependence","text":"That said, having the option to use different model forumations and actually using the ones that are implemented in land surface models directly when fitting leaf level measurements seems to be a prudent way to improve models in the future. More leaf level data might help in the future, especially looking at temperature dependencies, mesophyll conductance, and fluorescence yields. So many chemical and phsyical aspects change with temperature that it is hard to isolate impacting factors. Now, at least, we can run the models directly in the REPL, which is great for prototyping anc validating the model on the individual module level without any effort in terms of additional coding.","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Leaf-Photosynthesis-Rates/#","page":"Enzyme catalysis T-dependence","title":"Enzyme catalysis T-dependence","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"generated/Leaf-Photosynthesis-Rates/#","page":"Enzyme catalysis T-dependence","title":"Enzyme catalysis T-dependence","text":"This page was generated using Literate.jl.","category":"page"}]
